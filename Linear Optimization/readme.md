**Linear Optimization (Linear Programming Problem)**

Analysis of problems in which a linear function of a number of variables is to be maximized (minimized), when those variables are subject to a number of restraints in the form of linear inequalities. 

Linear Programming Problem (LPP) deals with efficient allocation of resources with the objective of meeting a desired goal.

Maximizing the profit with limited resources, manufacturing problem, allocation of bank funds, portfolio management, staffing problem are few examples.

An extension of LPP is found in assignment and transportation problems.

**Terminologies in LPP**
 
Decision variables: Unknowns whose values are to be determined from the solution of the problem.

Objective function: Mathematical equation in terms of unknown values of the decision variables.

Constraints or restrictions: The limitation imposed on the values of decision variables in the solution. These limitations exists due to limited availability of resources in the production of each unit of the decision variable.

Non-negativity restriction: Decision variables must be non-negative i.e. decision variables should assume either zero or positive values.

**Formulation of LPP**

There should be clearly identifiable objective and it should be measurable in quantitative terms.

The resources to be allocated should be identifiable and quantitatively measurable.

The relationship representing the objective function and the constraints equations must be linear.

The decision maker should have a series of feasible alternate courses of action. These are determined by the resource constraints.
